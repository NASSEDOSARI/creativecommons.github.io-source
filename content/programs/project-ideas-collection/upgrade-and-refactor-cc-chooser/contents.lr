title: Upgrade and Refactor CC Chooser
---
problem:
The Chooser has a stable initial UX, but due to bitrot its codebase is
approaching non-support.
---
expected_outcome:
Upgrade the codebase to current Vue.js versions and ancillary technologies
(Vite, Pinia), created more clarity and longevity in the codebase. Generate
clear documentation of codebase and functionality.
---
contributor_tasks:
The contributor will need to upgrade the codebase from Vue.js v2.x to Vue.js
v3.x, from Vue CLI to Vite, and from Vuex to Pinia. Incorporate new UX changes
using semantic,  standards compliant, and accessible JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Reduce the number of dependencies, and establish a stable automated process to
build out an embeddable Web Component compatible implementation. Knowledge of
the upgrade path from Vue 2.x implementations to Vue 3.x will be helpful, as
will knowledge of Web Components. Final implementation will have clear
documentation drafted within the codebase for future maintainability.
