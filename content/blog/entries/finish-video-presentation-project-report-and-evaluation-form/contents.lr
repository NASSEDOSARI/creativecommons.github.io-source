For week 10 and 11, I finished porting CC Catalog documentation, submitted a video presentation, and wrapped up my GSoD 2020 journey.

### Week 11

For Week 11, I finished working on porting CC Catalog documentation from internal wiki to CC Catalogâ€™s GitHub repository.
Kriti told me that there would be a meeting in which I have to present what I've done for GSoD.
Since the meeting will take place at 1AM in my local time, Kriti told me that I should send a video presentation instead.

### Week 12

For this week, I submitted a video presentation to Kriti.
Finished writing project report and evaluation for GSoD.
I published 2 blog posts this week.
One for updates on Week 11 and Week 12.
Another one is a summary of my GSoD 2020 journey, which also serves as a project report.
