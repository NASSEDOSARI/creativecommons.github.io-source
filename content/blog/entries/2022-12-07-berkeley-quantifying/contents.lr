## Project Objective


### Problem Statement

In the previous years, from 2014 to 2017, Creative Commons (CC) have been
releasing public reports detailing the growth, size, and usage of Creative
Commons, demonstrating the significance and influences of Creative Commons.
However, the effort to quantity Creative Commons has ceased at the proceeding
year. This is the preincarnation of our current open-source project:
[Quantifying the Commons](https://github.com/creativecommons/quantifying).

An example visualization from the previous report in 2017:
![2017 State of the Commons data graph](2017_state_of_the_commons_data.png)

The reason is that prior efforts to generate usage reports suffered unreliable
data retrieval methods; while prone to malfunction over the updates of website
architecture from data sources, these data extraction methods are not
particularly rigorous in performance and have a significantly low (compared to
current methods, at the scale or an hour v.s. 5 business days).

To advance and continue the work of quantifying CC product states, the student
researchers are delegated the design and implementation for reliable data
retrieval processes on CC data that were employed in previous reports to
replicate past efforts of this project's preincarnation, quantify the size and
diversity of CC Product Usage on the Internet.


## Data Retrieval


### How to detect county of CC-Licensed Documents?

If an online document uses a CC tool to protect it, then it will either be
labeled as license under that tool or contain a hyperlink towards a
creativecommons.org webpage that explains the license's rules (the deed).

Therefore, we may use the following approach to identify and count CC-licensed
documents:
1. Select a list of CC tools to inspect (provided by CC).
2. Use APIs of different online platforms to detect and count documents that
   are labeled as license by platform and/or contains a hyperlink towards CC
   license webpages.
3. Store these data in tabular form to contain the count of documents protected
   under each type of CC tools.


### What platforms to collect counts from?

Here is a list of online platforms that we sampled document count from, as well
as the delegations for platforms' data collection, visualization, and modeling
in this project:

| Platforms Containing Webpages | Platforms Containing Photos | Platforms containing Videos |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Google (Dun-Ming Huang) | DeviantArt (Dun-Ming Huang) | Vimeo (Dun-Ming Huang) |
| Internet Archive (Dun-Ming Huang) | Flickr (Shuran Yang) | YouTube (Dun-Ming Huang) |
| | MetMuseum (Dun-Ming Huang) | |
| | WikiCommons (Dun-Ming Huang) | |


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Here are some significant defects found in datasets across sampled platforms
during EDA:


### Flickr

- Sampled Document Count from this dataset is at 35,000% ~ 100,000% of
  deviation from official statistics per CC product (license) investigated.
- Sampling frame locked at 4,000 available searched photos from each license.
- Significant duplication issue (resolved).


#### Google Custom Search API

- Programmable Search Engine only reaches a subset of Google's website. The
  impact is not significant (then, further resolved via sampling frame
  adjustments in PSE).
- Accidentally used deprecated operators and parameters, causing faithfulness
  problems (resolved).


#### YouTube Data API

- API has maximum response value on total count of YouTube videos, causing
  severe underestimate.
  - Resolved via implementing custom granularity on data to enable honest
    response, conserve development cost, and introduce imputations in
    visualization.


### Expanding the Dataset

Here are reasons and efforts of dataset expansion on platforms that received
more data:


#### Google Custom Search API

- Revised Data Sampling process to solve EDA-discovered inaccuracies.
- For expanding the horizons of CC product usage analyses upon past boundaries,
  where visualization was only conducted to compare cross-product performance,
  I incorporated further CC-product usage data across temporal axis and
  geographical demographics.


#### YouTube Data API

- Revised Data Sampling process to solve EDA-discovered inaccuracies.
- To perform unprecedented analyses on media-specific time-respective
  developments of CC options on popular platforms, YouTube's CC-licensed
  video count across two-month periods.
- Introduced imputation to alleviate unresolvable capped responses from YouTube
  and mitigate developmental cost in response to Youtube API's capping
  behaviour.


## Visualization


### Philosophies and Principles

The visualizations of Quantifying the Commons is to be communicative and
exhibitory.

Some new aesthetics and principles we adopted (as a response to enhancement of
prior efforts) are to:
- Present length in place of area for comprehensibility
- Analyze product development beyond license-wise comparisons
- Utilize colors for presenting data inclinations via works in Pandas, Seaborn,
  NumPy, Geopandas, and SpaCy


### Exhibiting a Selection of Visualizations


#### Diagram 1C

Trend Chart of Creative Commons Usage on Google
![Trend Chart of Creative Commons Usage on Google](diagram_1c.png)

There are now **more than 2.7 Billion webpages protected by Creative Commons**
indexed by Google!


#### Diagram 2

![Heatmap on density of CC-licensed Google indexed webpages over country](diagram_2.png)

Particularly, **Western Europe and Americas enjoy a much robust use** of
Creative Commons document in terms of quantity. A Development in Asia and
Africa should be encouraged.


#### Diagram 3C

![Barplot for number of webpages protected by six primary CC licenses](diagram_3c.png)

We can see that **Attribution** (BY) and **Attribution-Nonderivative (BY-ND)
are popular licenses** among the 3 billion documents sampled across the
dataset.


#### Diagram 6

Barplot of CC-licensed documents across Free Culture and Non Free Culture
licenses
![Barplot of CC-licensed documents across Free Culture and Non Free Culture licenses](diagram_6.png)

Roughly **45.3% of the documents under CC protection are covered by Free
Culture** legal tools.


#### Flickr Diagrams

Usage of CC licenses on Flickr concentrated on Australia, Brazil, United Stated
of America while is pretty low in Asia countries.

**Note:** Sampling Frame of these visualizations are locked at the first 4,000
search results on photos under each general license types.

##### Diagram 7B

![Flickr maximum views of pictures under all licenses](diagram_7b.png)

Photos on Flickr under Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (BY-NC-ND) license has
gained highest possible views, while usage of license Public Domain Mark has
highest increasing trend in recent years.

#### Diagram 8

Number of works under Creative Commons Tools across Platforms
![Number of works under Creative Commons Tools across Platforms](diagram_8.png)

DeviantArt presents the most number of works under Creative Commons licenses
and tools, followed by Wikipedia and WikiCommons. The estimate of video counts
on YouTube is understimated, as demonstrated in Diagram 11B.


#### Diagram 9B

![Trend Chart of Cumulative Count of CC-Licensed YouTube Videos across Each Two-Months](diagram_11b.png)

The **orange line stand for the imputed value of new CC-Licensed YouTube video
counts based on linear regression,** which is the decided method of imputation
because most medias' growth of CC-licensed document count also experience a
linear growth.


## Modeling

(A side track)


### Objectives of Modeling

The models of this project aim to answer: "What is the license typing of a
webpage/web document given its content?"

Individual researchers have attempted each of their solutions via different
resources, metrics, under different modeling contexts:


#### Model of Google Webpages (Dun-Ming Huang)

- Modeling Context: Multiclass Classifier (7 classes).
- Modeling Training set: Text webpage contents acquired from Google API
  collected webpages (Common Crawl, the original choice, was marked
  unavailable due to source code corruption).
- Main Model Metric: Top-k accuracy, as this model is considered as the backend
  of a license recommendation system that receives webpage content and
  recommend 2 to 3 licenses to the user.


#### Model for Flickr Photos (Shuran Yang)

- Modeling Context: Binary Classifier (BY vs. BY-SA)
- Modeling Training set: Text photo descriptions acquired from Flickr API (with
  sampling frame of visualizations)
- Main Model Metric: Accuracy

## Next Steps


### From Preincarnation to Present

Via the efforts addressed above, we have not only managed to transform a data
retrieval process from unstable, unexplored, and unavailable into an
algorithmic, deterministic process reliable, documented, and interpretable! And
the visualizations have become more exhibitory, concentrating on more
effortfully extracted insights, and look at Creative Commons in further depth
and more remarkable breadth.

With significant re-implementations and designing policies to the data
retrieval process for Quantifying the Commons, visualizations can be readily,
immediately produced upon command; and upon the conceptual transformations of
visualization production, Creative Commons will obtain new insights into the
development of product and eventual policies upon the axes along which data was
extracted from. Furthermore, we expect the production of model to work beyond
the bounds of a Machine Learning product, but as a possibility to draw
inferences upon product usage upon.

**Such efforts are a short jump start to the long-term reincarnation of
Quantifying the Commons.**


### From Reincarnation onto Baton Touches

The current team would encourage the future team to increase the availability
and user experience for our open source data extraction method, via automation
and by-batch data extraction methods, for which Dun-Ming has written a design
policy for. For modeling, the team also encourage building ingerence pipelines
for using ELI5 for Logistic Regression models, as well as experiment more with
loss function options of Gradient Boosting Classifier. For Flickr, the writer
of this poster would like to suggest some data extraction method outside Flickr
API but has access towards Flickr media, say Google Custom Search API.
