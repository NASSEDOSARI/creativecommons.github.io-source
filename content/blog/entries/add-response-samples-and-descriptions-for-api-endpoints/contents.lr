Well, hello again ðŸ‘‹! For week 3 and week 4, I added response samples and descriptions for API endpoints. Writing documentation feels a bit like coding at this point because I need to read a lot about drf-yasg, dig through issues and questions at Github / Stackoverflow to ensure that I donâ€™t ask redundant (or even stupid) questions.

### Week 3

Week 3 was quite hectic. I moved back to my hometown during week 3.
Took 3 days off to settle my stuff and set up a workspace.
I worked on my GSoD project for only 2 days, Monday and Tuesday.
I managed to create response samples for most API endpoints.
Had a monthly video call with Kriti this week.

### Week 4

For this week, I reviewed what Iâ€™ve done and what I havenâ€™t to estimate new completion time.
Thank god, I have a buffer week in my GSoD timeline and deliverables.
So yeah, all is good in terms of completion time.
I started to write descriptions for API endpoints.
Submitted first PR and published blog entry.

Over and out.
