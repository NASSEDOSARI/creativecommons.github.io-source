You've joined the CC Community Team. Congratulations! This is a very clear
indication of your desire to engage more deeply with the Creative Commons
community. As a fully remote organisation, CC uses a lot of tools to stay
organised and collaborate. As you join the Community Team, depending on your
role, you will be granted different levels of access to these tools and
software.

Given the breadth and diversity of these tools coupled with varying levels of
access, it can be easy to not know what is expected of you and how you can make
the most of your involvement. This guide will condense this information down to
help you identify the best ways to engage with the team. _Let's get started!_

## Meetings

We regularly hold meetings to discuss work and, occasionally, to play games.
Based on your role and the project, you will be invited to some of these
meetings. You can join the CC Engineering calendar to keep up with the schedule.

### Community meeting

In this meeting, all the staff and open-source community at CC meet to discuss
work. Any major discussions and ideas that affect the projects or process take
place in this meeting. It's also a channel to know what is happening in a
parallel project that you don't get to interact with as much. We have a Show &
Tell, so if you did or made something recently that you think is interesting,
you can present that.

**Frequency:** monthly

### Vocabulary sprint planning

In this meeting, the Vocabulary sprint planning meeting is where all members
involved in Vocabulary meet. This is mainly held to determine reasonable
milestones on what can be accomplished in the next two weeks and assign
different tasks and tickets to different people. If you'd like to get involved
with Vocabulary code you can pick up some tasks here.

**Frequency:** fortnightly

## Slack

We communicate over text using Slack. Everyone from the community is on it,
including CC employees. You can find fellow developers, technical writers and
designers all in the same place. If you are, or want to be, a part of the
community, [join us on Slack](/community/#slack). It is one of the best ways to
connect with us.

Slack is organised by channels and, depending on your role, you will be invited
to these channels to participate in discussions about certain topics.

### Newbie channels

There are a number of channels which budding open source developers join in
hopes of finding like-minded developers. You should help them get started, clear
simple doubts, introduce them to FOSS and make them feel welcome in our
community. After all, the more the merrier!

**Channel:** `#general`, `#cc-dev-workprograms`, `#cc-developers`

### Community team channel

This is a channel where you can connect with other members of the Community
Team. Announcements pertaining to the Community Team and planned changes to the
community will be announced here first.

**Channel:** `#cc-dev-community-team`

### Engineering channel

This is a channel where the entire engineering team of CC can be reached.

**Channel:** `#engineering`

### UX design channels

This is the channel where we discuss design and UI/UX of various CC software and
websites. This is particularly relevant to the Vocabulary project. The Figma
specific channel mostly posts updates from the Figma documents of all the
various projects.

**Channel:** `#ux-design`, `#ux-design-figma`

## Mailing lists

We also have a few mailing lists where we communicate announcements and the
like. Join us on our [Google Group mailing lists](/community/#mailing-lists) if
you are, or want to be, a part of the community.

### Developer group

This group is for all developers who are associated or related to the
open-source community around our projects.

**Address:** cc-developers@creativecommons.org

### Usability Announcements group

This group is for all people participating in our Usability testing sessions.
Announcements of upcoming tests are made in this group.

**Address:** usability-announce@creativecommons.org

### Community Team group

This group is for all CC tech staff and everyone on the Community Team.

**Address:** community-team@creativecommons.org

## GitHub

All our code is hosted on GitHub, we use issues to track bugs and identify
features and pull requests to improve the software and drive it forward. All
Community Team members with the role of
[Project Collaborator](/community/community-team/project-roles/#project-collaborator)
or higher are added to the
[CC organisation](https://github.com/creativecommons/)
on GitHub.

We use GitHub teams to manage access levels for all members of the organisation.
Each role in a particular project corresponds to a certain access level over the
repositories that are a part of that project. As you change your role, you will
automatically be added to the appropriate team.

The [GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#repository-access-for-each-permission-level)
are the best place to learn about these access levels.

### Read access

Read access offers no special privileges over issues or pull requests. You can
nevertheless contribute to the repository by forking it to your account and
making PRs as usual. You can also partake in discussions and help new
contributors get started when fixing simpler issues.

### Triage access

Triage access grants you the privileges required to review incoming issues and
classify them by priority, goal, value added to the project and so on and apply
the appropriate labels to them. You will be added to a project's `CODEOWNERS`
and will automatically be assigned PRs to review. You can approve them or
request changes as necessary and can prevent a PR from being merged.

### Write access

Write access grants you the privileges required to create branches on the
repository, push to the repository directly and merge pull requests that have
been approved. You can even commit changes to open pull requests to make them
ready for merge and can draft new releases for the project.

### Maintain access

Maintain access grants you the privileges to manage almost all aspects of the
repository, except any destructive action or sensitive information. You can
modify the repositories' topics, description and social cards among other
settings.

## Twitter

Twitter is our preferred social media platform. We don't have a LinkedIn or
Facebook presence. We generally post updates from our projects, introduce newly
published blog posts, announce new releases of our software and any other
interested information related to both FOSS and Creative Commons.

While [CC Open Source](https://twitter.com/cc_opensource) has a rather humble
Twitter following, our tweets are often retweeted by
[the parent Creative Commons handle](https://twitter.com/creativecommons).

### Edit access

You can see all the upcoming tweets from Creative Commons, suggest any
improvements to the text or the material, suggest new topics for the tweets, and
even write tweets that will be published, after review, from the official
Twitter handle.

### Publish access

You can post or schedule the tweets to be published from the official Twitter
handle. You can also interact with the open source community on Twitter and
access the official Twitter stats to further improve our outreach and engagement
metrics.
